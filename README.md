# Hora de decir bye-bye

## Aim of this project
Analyze usage of English in Spanish language women's magazines (and usage of Spanish in English language women's magazines) in the US.

## Outline

1. Get some data: scrape magazine articles from
  * siempremujer.com
  * latina.com

2 Text pre-processing
  * convert to plain text

3. Annotate text
  * look up all the words in Spanish/English dictionaries (use open offices dictionaries)
  * annotate language (may be both possible)

4. Get n-grammes with alternating language use

5. Try to generalize some contexts where such n-grammes appear
